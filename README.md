Hey, IcePickCyberSolutions! It's nice to meet you.

In my repos you'll find a bunch of tools for various tasks in various areas.
All I hope is that you'll find them useful and even perhaps move you to explore and learn, maybe help others do the same?

Anyway, my philosophy is that having more knowledgeable and hopeful people the internet will be much more safe, useful, interesting, and beneficial for us humans.
By making tools, resources, and information that is freely available to all I can encourage others to create their own, creative solutions to problems. 

Feel free to use any of the code, ideas, information, and concepts that I put out (though credit much appreciated).
What matters most is that more people understand how things work so they can have input and opinions on how the world is built and how it runs. 

Feel free to check me out on my other socials:
